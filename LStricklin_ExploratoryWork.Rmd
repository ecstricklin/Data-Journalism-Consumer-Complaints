## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

QUESTIONS I HAVE:
1. Have the complaints increased over time?
2. Which states had the most complaints?
i rly would like to compare this to previous years but i guess that isn't an option
3. What companies had the most issues? Are there any companies that have overwhelmingly more complaints?

Let's test these out:

1. Have the complaints increased over time?

```{r}
complaints2 <- complaints %>%
  count(date_received)

fig <- plot_ly(complaints2, x = ~date_received, y = ~n, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines')
fig %>% layout(title = 'title', yaxis=list(title = 'date_received'), xaxis = list(title='n'))
fig
```
conclusion! complaints have nearly doubled since march!

2. Which states had the most complaints?

```{r}
complaints3 <- complaints %>%
  count(state)

fig2 <- plot_ly(complaints3, x = ~state, y = ~n, type = 'bar')
fig2 %>% layout(title = 'title', yaxis=list(title = 'state'), xaxis = list(title='n'))
fig2
```

conclusion! florida, california, and texas have a ton of complaints compared to everyone else!

3. What companies had the most issues?

```{r}

complaints4 <- complaints %>%
  count(company)

fig3 <- plot_ly(complaints4, x = ~company, y = ~n, type = 'bar')
fig3 %>% layout(title = 'title', yaxis=list(title = 'company'), xaxis = list(title='n'))
fig3

```

conclusion! experian, transunion, and equifax take the cake!
